Weapon of Mass Collaboration

Bob Dylan once wrote, “The Times They Are a-Changin’”, at least with the advent of the internet the times indeed have changed. But the internet is no longer about hooking online, creating a garden community, or putting a video on You Tube. It’s mass collaboration or peer production that’s been the real head turner. 

Entire world is starting to participate and collaborate. The old norms like developing and working under strict hierarchical lines of authority inside the corporate boundary is diminishing and now business thinking might be going through one of the biggest changes in the history. Now, the customers can co-create goods and services rather than simply consuming the end products for an organization. 

In the past collaboration was small scale limited to friends, colleagues and family but now with the changes in technology, demographics, business, the economy and the world, people participate and collaborate like never before. Millions of people share their news, information and views in blogs that can rival any newspaper. 

People from different corners of the world are now working together and sharing ideas like never before. They are working as one giant self organizing brain that can match R&D of any multi billion dollar organization. If you have studied the subject “Technology, Environment and Society”, somewhere you’ll come across a phrase “The new source of power is not money in the hands of the few but information in the hand of many.” 

Many of companies have taken a liking to this phenomenon and reaping the fruits of its open source approach. An individual can now create a wide array of free and open source goods and services that anyone can use or modify. Yes, this is what Linux operating system is doing. With Linux, typically all the underlying source code can be used, freely modified, and redistributed, both commercially and non-commercially by anyone under GNU General Public License.   

Other companies like InnoCentive are also utilizing this approach. InnoCentive is an "open innovation" company that takes research and development problems in a broad range of domains such as engineering, computer science, math, chemistry, life sciences, physical sciences and business and frames them as "challenge problems" for anyone to solve them. It gives cash awards for the best solutions to solvers who meet the challenge criteria.

A new blog is created every second. Facebook is on its way to half a billion users. Wikipedia has become the next Britannica. Indeed, mass collaboration is the force to be reckoned with. Mass collaboration will bring about a cultural insurrection so, powerful that it will disrupt the very fabric of our society. 

This article is highly inspired by the book “Wikinomics: How mass collaboration changes everything”.
